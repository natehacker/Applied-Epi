        <h2>Case Management Systems</h2>
        <p><br><br> Medical examiner and coroner (MEC) offices often used software-based case management systems (CMS) to collect, organize, and store case-related data. MEC office staff enter case-related data using
            standardized variables or forms to create a uniform data set that can be queried or analyzed. Depending on the features of the software, these systems can also be used to facilitate data sharing with stakeholders, such as law enforcement
            or public health.
